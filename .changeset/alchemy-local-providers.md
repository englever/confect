Run `Convex` resources against a local Convex backend under `alchemy dev`. The same stack deploys to Convex cloud with `alchemy deploy`; with `alchemy dev`, `Convex.providers()` resolves each resource to a local implementation that needs no Convex account or credentials.

```sh
pnpm alchemy dev
# choose the backend's ports from a range instead of letting the OS pick
CONFECT_LOCAL_BACKEND_PORTS=3300-3399 pnpm alchemy dev
```

A local `Convex.Deployment` downloads and runs the Convex backend release `precompiled-2026-10-06-a3538c6`, keeps its data and URL across sessions in `.alchemy/convex/<stack>/<stage>/<deployment>`, and stops when the dev session ends. `Convex.DeployKey` returns the backend's admin key, environment variables are set before code is pushed, and the data is reused by the next session; it is deleted only when the deployment is destroyed with `RemovalPolicy.destroy()`.

Pushes to one deployment from the same machine now wait for each other, in the cloud and locally, so concurrent pushes no longer fail with "Schema was overwritten by another push".

The `region` output of `Convex.Deployment` is now optional: cloud deployments always report it, and local deployments report it only when it was requested.
