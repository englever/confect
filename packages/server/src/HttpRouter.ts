/**
 * A layer that registers routes on the HTTP router—the input to {@link make}.

 * Compose it from Effect's `effect/http` and `effect/http-api` modules:
 * `HttpApiBuilder.layer(api)` registers an `HttpApi`'s endpoints (provide its
 * group handler layers with `Layer.provide`), `HttpApiScalar.layer(api, ...)`
 * serves interactive API docs, `HttpRouter.add` registers a plain route, and
 * `HttpRouter.middleware(fn, { global: true })` applies middleware to every
 * route. Merge any number of these with `Layer.mergeAll`.
 *
 * Route handlers and middleware may require any of the Confect {@link Services},
 * which surface as request-level `Requires` markers and are supplied per
 * request. Anything else the layer requires is a type error—notably, an
 * `HttpApiBuilder.layer(api)` whose group handler layers are not provided
 * leaves an `HttpApiGroup.ToService` requirement behind, so a missing handler
 * group is caught at compile time.
 *
 * Layers are built with Confect's Convex-aware `ConfigProvider` in context, so
 * `Config` reads (e.g. in `Layer.unwrap`) resolve against Convex environment
 * variables.
